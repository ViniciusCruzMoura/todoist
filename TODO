Problem, how to share a directory with the host without networking in QEMU?
perhaps using filemanager solve the problem

Problem, how to read the USB or others devices inside the QEMU?

Uninter programação estruturada apol 1

Research QEMU and noVNC to make a Windows server portable and easy to reproduce as a docker container

Redeploy Jenkins agent and manager but with current network 'srv_default' so I need to recreate everything and configure from scratch

Get all source code inside the server and migrate them to gitea

Deploy dozzle on hostinger server, and investigate how use a authenticated user

Problem, why does the dozzle agent not work inside a cloudflare dns proxy? Is it a config issue?

Invetigate the UrBackup solution and alternatives

Problem, how to make a backup server? backup the git, database, and docker volumes

Investigate a better solution for authenticated users in Dozzle or find another way for only internal users to access public DNS

Think, is it a good idea to use an obscure subdomain? And if I need to change it in the future, will it be difficult?

Investigate the GLPI, how to config and how integrate with email and git?

Investigate the IdeIA server. What files are there? Why? What is the story behind them?
What is running inside the server? Using which ports? Who is actually using it in a production environment?
Is there a possibility to clean up the server? By removing .db files? How is a new DNS created? Who sets up the proxy?
Why is the DNS using strange names?

To help with development, I need to solve the source code management problem, as the code is only on the local development machine
and deployment is done manually.

===
Solved and Done! i discovered new problems!
===
Create a directory "/home/infra/workspace/docker/" on hostinger server
Deploy gitea with docker compose on hostinger server
Test and Rehearse docker volumes backups
Search and investigate the reasons of why volumes is better than absolute path
Deploy jenkins manager and jenkins agent on hosting server
Create a new subdomain for gitea, jenkins and dozzle
Configure the nginx proxy of gitea, jenkins and dozzle

Solved!

Problem, when restore the container volume, it's creating a "/from/from" directory instead of "/from",
the question is why? and how to solve this behaviour?
Solution, you need to go to the directory to get the files only, otherwise it will get the folder
===

Deploy and explore a localhost gitea solution, create a docker compose, and know how to backup and recover volumes

How to implement AABB collision and collision resolution?
What is the difference compared to Swept AABB and other 2D collisions?
We have two rectangles, for each we must check for overlap on the X-Axis and the Y-Axis
    A.min < B.max && B.min < A.max



















On the cardterminais, remove the email "vinicius.moura@cardway.com.br".
    grep -n "vinicius.moura@cardway.com.br" apps/terminal_android/views/remessa.py

On the cardterminais, extract the send email logic from view. Run the
following command to find where need change.
    grep -n "enviar_comprovante_de_aceite_via_email(.*" apps/terminal_android/views/remessa.py
Refactor these implementations.

On the cardcredenciamento, avoid nested ifs of 'estabelecimentos_info' variable. Run the 
following command to get the list of functions.
    grep -rn --include=*.py "def buscar_cliente_id(.*):"

On the cardconnect, remove the environment variable not used in the 'docker-compose.yml'
and 'settings.py'. Run the following command to get the list of environment variable.
    echo "$PWD/core/settings.py:"
    for line in $(cat .env.example); do
        grep -n "${line//=/\',}" core/settings.py
    done
    echo "$PWD/docker-compose.yml:"
    for line in $(cat .env.example); do
         grep -n "${line//=/}" docker-compose.yml
    done
Then delete the unused variable and test the apis inside the docker container.
    docker build --network=host -t $(basename $PWD) .
    docker run -it --rm --network=host --env-file .env --name $(basename $PWD) \
        -v "$PWD":/"$(basename $PWD)" -w /"$(basename $PWD)" $(basename $PWD) bash
Fix these uses by change environment variable values.
